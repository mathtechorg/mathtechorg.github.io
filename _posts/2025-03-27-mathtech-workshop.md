On behalf of the [MathTech.org Team](/about/), I'm excited to announce
our first-ever virtual workshop! Join us via Zoom this May 19-22 (times TBA)
to learn how to author accessible course materials, requiring nothing more
than your web browser and an internet connection.

Details are coming soon! Follow us here and on
[BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/mathtech.org) for updates.
