An essential element of my [Team-Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL)](https://TBIL.org) classroom
is that, as much as possible, students whould be discovering knowledge for themselves,
rather than just being told.

However, I only have 150 minutes with my students each week! And while I'd love to
give them the expeirence of my own inquiry-based learning classrooms (a list of
problems to solve and theorems to prove, a pat on the head, and a "go get 'em, show
us in class next week what you were able to figure out"), that level of unscaffolded exploration
is frankly not appropriate for the majority of my students, who are mostly non-mathematics
STEM majors.

To this end, a TBIL classroom emphasizes the need for "Scaffolded Exploration", where students
are given enough tools, preparation, and context to authentically engage with an activity
using inquiry, without leaving them rudderless and unable to even begin to puzzle things out.

One mechanism to do this is to provide students interactive applets to help them explore
mathematical concepts. While many of us who went on to teach in the mathematical sciences
are quite comfortable with drawing several examples to explore a new concept, or even
visualizing things in our own heads, many students have not yet developed such skills, or
at least are not prepared or confident enough to run to a whiteboard or their paper to do
so in a small group of their peers.

I found this particularly tricky when I first introduced
[geometric properties of linear maps](https://library.tbil.org/2025/linear-algebra/GT.html)
in my sophomore (engineering-majority) linear algebra course. Asking students to consider
how changing the length of a parallelogram's base affects the change in its area isn't
a terribly deep question, but it's one that definitely benefits from visualization.

So in
[Activity 5.1.8 (2024 Early Edition)](https://teambasedinquirylearning.github.io/linear-algebra/2024e/GT1.html#activity-140)
I provided such a static image:
