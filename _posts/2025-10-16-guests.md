Continuing my series on [Getting Started with GitHub](/2025/10/10/github-history.html), I thought I should
point out that you can directly contribute your own guest post to our blog using your GitHub account,
and it's probably easier than you think!

The first step is to create a [fork](https://g4m.code4math.org/ch-collaboration.html#def-forks) of
[our `mathtechorg.github.io` repository](https://github.com/StevenClontz/mathtechorg.github.io).
With just two clicks, you'll have your own personal copy of our entire blog on your own GitHub account!
Assuming you're already logged into GitHub (or [created your free account](https://github.com/signup)),
click "Fork", and then on the next page click the green "Create Fork" button with all the default settings.

Now that you have your own copy of the MathTech.org blog repository (congrats!),
click on the `_posts` folder to see the source files for all our posts:

To start writing your own post, just click "Add File"
and "Create new file".

Now you're almost there! You'll need to name the file
in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-words.md`, and include this
"YAML metadata" at the top of your file:

```

title: Title goes here!
tags: words that are related
author: Firstname Lastname
comments: true

Write your blog in plain text here!

Or learn about [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)!
```

When you're ready, click the green "Commit Changes" button.
Your "commit message" should briefly describe your post,
and the "extended description" can go into more detail.
Importantly, be sure to "Create a **new branch**"
([whatever that is](
https://g4m.code4math.org/ch-git-github.html#sec-what-is-git-4))
which can be named whatever is default.

One more step remains: it's time to create a
["pull request"](https://g4m.code4math.org/ch-collaboration.html#def-pull-request)!
This is where you can tell us what your post is about,
and why it's a great fit for MathTech.org.

After a discussion (if necessary!) we'll hopefully merge
your "PR" and your post will immediately go live. Congrats!

Of course, maybe you're not sure if your post is perfect for our blog, and why
write it all out just to be told it's not what we're looking for? That's a great point,
which is why we have our [Issues tracker](https://github.com/mathtechorg/mathtechorg.github.io/issues)
where we plan and discuss our upcoming posts before they are written, or our
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/64tkJueD6G) where all discussion about technologies
supporting math education are invited and encouraged. Connect with us and let's chat!

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing more about Git and GitHub
with the community very soon.
