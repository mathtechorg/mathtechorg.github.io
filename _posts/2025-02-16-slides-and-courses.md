Did you know that you can use PreTeXt to create revealjs slideshows?  

Did you know that you can use PreTeXt to create a course website?

I gave a talk today at the SIMIODE EXPO 2025 arguing for why PreTeXt is the authoring tool of choice for creating course materials.  I did so using a slideshow created in PreTeXt.  You can view the [presentation slides](/assets/slides/simiode2025/) to see how cool PreTeXt-generated slides are and learn how easy it is to create course content.
