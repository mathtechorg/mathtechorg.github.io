A quite popular ecosystem for authoring and sharing
scholarly documents is [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org).
Using PreTeXt guarantees that you can "write once, read anywhere":
once you've written your document in PreTeXt, you can build and deploy
interactive webpages, printable PDFs, and even files that can be used
to emboss tactile braille!

One of the most common questions I'm asked is "How do I even get started?".
[Oscar](https://math.oscarlevin.com/) and I (not to mention many others!)
have hosted several in-person and virtual workshops to help folks get started,
and a great place to look out for future workshops is
[the PROSE Consortium calendar](https://prose.runestone.academy/events/).

But if you're itching to get started right now, the
[**Getting Started Tutorial of the PreTeXt Guide**](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/tutorial.html)
is your friend! All you need is an internet connection
and and updated web browser, so why wait?

And if you're stuck, come chat with us in the
[PROSE Consortium Discord](https://discord.gg/UScmJVa25f)
or connect live in a
[PROSE Consortium Zoom Drop-In](https://prose.runestone.academy/events/).
We look forward to helping you!
