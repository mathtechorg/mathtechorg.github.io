While anyone in the mathematical sciences should have no trouble engaging in
the development of software supporting math-related instruction, I find that
many colleagues are daunted by the first steps to move beyond hacking out
a spreadsheet or script for their personal use. And I get it --
those of us working on the theoretical side of things often want our development
environments and collaboration tooling to "just work", so we can focus on the
interesting task of creating a new great pedagogical tool for our classroom
(and beyond!).

I think a lot folks don't realize that this isn't even unique to mathematics-adjacent
faculty dipping their toes into software development. There's a whole subdiscpline
of engineering focused on "Developer Operations" (DevOps), dedicated to abstracting
that boring nonsense away, so even professional software engineers can focus on their
core work without worrying about the little details of what makes their computers work
or allows their contributions to become a part of a larger project.

This is why I'm so passionate about training mathematicians about modern cloud development
infrastructure powered by GitHub: in 2025, *so much* of this frustrating setup can
be replaced by big green buttons in your web browser. Push this button, and after waiting
a few minutes, everything you need to write software for mathematics education, *and*
share and collaborate with other mathematicians on such projects, is at your fingertips,
whether you're on Windows, Linux, or a smart toaster (assuming it has Chrome installed).

My handbook [*GitHub for Mathematicians*](https://g4m.code4math.org) (which is itself
an open collaborative project including contributions from several colleagues) is available
to you to learn how to take advantage of these tools for yourself, and I'm excited to
announce that I'll be running my next **Getting Started with GitHub** Zoom workshop
on December 15 and 17 this winter.

You can [register on ScholarLattice](https://preview.scholarlattice.org/collections/82bace2a-c3ce-4dfc-9089-4feb05dd8af7)
now, but I thought it'd be helpful to start a series of posts where I point out some of my
favorite topics from this book and training.

Today, I wanted to look at how Git tracks the history of a project.
