Welcome to MathTech.org.  We are a community of mathematicians using and creating open-source technologies to innovate mathematics education.  Join us!

In this initial post we will share some of our goals for this site.

## PROSE continues

The [PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy) was founded through an NSF grant to bring together the ecosystem of various open-source products and communities serving STEM education research and practice in North America, joined by their common mission: to equip STEM teachers with open-source content, tools and strategies that provide engaging, accessible, and effective learning experiences for their students.

Many of the activities of PROSE continue even after the grant has ended; MathTech.org is intended as a hub for these activities, especially those related to mathematics (broadly construed to include statistics, computer science, and mathematics education).

For us, the promise of PROSE is based both in its core open-source technologies and the community of people who use and improve them.  Open Educational Resources (OER) authored in [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) can be published in [Runestone](https://runestone.academy) to create interactive textbooks.  These textbooks can include assessments in [WeBWorK](https://webwork.maa.org) to provide students with immediate feedback on their work.  The [Doenet](https://doenet.org) platform can be used to create interactive activities that can be embedded in Runestone textbooks as well.  These technologies are all open-source and can be freely used and modified by anyone.
