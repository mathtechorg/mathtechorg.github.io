Concerned about the accessibility of your course documents? [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/) is the answer.

Based on feedback from our last workshop, our February workshop will start out using the new [PreTeXt.plus](https://pretext.plus) online editor so we can dive into the structure of PreTeXt documents right away.  We will then describe how to transition to a full PreTeXt setup for more complex documents using either a local install or Github Codespaces.

Participants of this workshop will be introduced to the fundamentals of authoring documents with PreTeXt and gain the technical skills required to work with it, particularly to author course materials such as *worksheets*.

Participants should have some familiarity with LaTeX or other markup languages, but no previous experience working with PreTeXt or HTML/XML is assumed.

Registration is free and open to all.

### Workshop content

We will work step-by-step to guide all participants through the process of writing a standalone document using the online PreTeXt.plus editor.  Then we will see how to:

- Use GitHub Codespaces to manage a larger PreTeXt project.
- Write and structure content using PreTeXt markup.
- Add content to the document, including mathematics, graphics, interactive exercises, and more.
- Build accessible and interactive webpages as well as a static PDF from the same PreTeXt source.
- Easily deploy the interactive webpages online (for free).

We will also share tips for converting existing documents into PreTeXt.
