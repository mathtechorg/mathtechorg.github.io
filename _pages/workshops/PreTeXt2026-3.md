In this short Getting Started workshop, we will walk through the steps to create a PreTeXt Worksheet inside the online PreTeXt.Plus editor.  

Participants should have some familiarity with LaTeX or other markup languages, but no previous experience working with PreTeXt or HTML/XML is assumed.

Registration is free and open to all.

### Workshop content

We will work step-by-step to guide all participants through the process of writing a standalone worksheet document using the online PreTeXt.plus editor.  This will include:

- Add content to the document, including mathematics, workspace, interactive exercises, and more.
- Build accessible and interactive webpages that can be shared or embedded inside an LMS.
