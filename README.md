# MathTech.org

Public website for MathTechOrg.

The site is generated by Jekyll, based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) template.

## Posts

To submit a blog entry, create a `md` file in the `_posts` directory.  Look for examples of posts there for formatting help.

## Building the site

When the site is pushed to github, it will automatically rebuild.  To preview locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.  Note, some changes to `_config.yml` require stopping and starting this, while other changes to the site should be automatically incorporated.

See the [Minimal Mistakes Documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) for more.
